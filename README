The extended system is the base system with the following modifications:

 - Used HMM alignments instead of IBM1 alignments
 - Added bilingual dictionary information from Wiktionary

-t paramater for the align script was (by langauge):
   bg = 0.3
   de = 0.4
   es = 0.5

A threshold of 0.3, for example, means that the lowest scoring 30% of alignments were dropped.
