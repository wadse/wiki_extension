Zwei kleine Italiener
`` Zwei kleine Italiener '' -LRB- `` Two little Italians '' -RRB- was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1962 , performed in German by Conny Froboess .
The song was performed seventh on the night , following Sweden ` s Inger Berggren with `` Sol och vÃ¥r `` and preceding the Netherlands ` De Spelbrekers with `` Katinka `` .
At the close of voting , it had received 9 points , placing 6th in a field of 16 .
The song -LRB- with lyrics by Georg Buschor and music by Christian Bruhn -RRB- is a moderately up-tempo number , with Froboess describing the plight of two gastarbeiters from Italy who wish to return to their homeland to be with their girlfriends , Tina and Marina .
She contrasts this situation with that of the rest of German society -LRB- at the time undergoing the Wirtschaftswunder largely as a result of immigrant labour -RRB- , for whom `` a journey to the South is something chic and fine '' .
The two Italians , it seems , despair of ever returning to Naples .
This unusual subject matter marks the first time that a social issue was described in a Contest entry .
Despite its middle-of-the-table finish , the song has become a minor favourite among Contest fans .
Froboess herself recorded versions of the song in English -LRB- as `` Gino '' -RRB- , Dutch -LRB- `` Twee kleine Italianen '' -RRB- and Italian -LRB- `` Un bacio all'italiana '' -RRB- .
Of these , only the Dutch version relates to the same topic .
The English version is a love song to a man named Gino , while the Italian version describes her preference for lovers from that country .
It was succeeded as German representative at the 1963 contest by Heidi BrÃ¼hl with `` Marcel `` .

Kenny Jönsson
Per Anders Kenny JÃ¶nsson -LRB- born October 6 , 1974 -RRB- is a Swedish professional ice hockey player playing for RÃ¶gle BK of the Swedish Elitserien .
Playing career
JÃ¶nsson was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1st round as the 12th overall selection in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft .
After playing with the Toronto club during the 1994â95 lockout shortened season , he was traded midway through the 1995â96 season to the New York Islanders in a player exchange which brought highly popular former captain Wendel Clark back to Toronto .
JÃ¶nsson has spent most of his career as a professional player with the Islanders .
After playing with the Swedish second division team RÃ¶gle BK , where he started his career , during the 2004â05 NHL lockout , he announced in the summer of 2005 that he was staying with the club for the 2005â06 season .
JÃ¶nsson played with the Islanders from 1996 through 2004 .
Fans and journalists considered JÃ¶nsson one of the most underrated defensemen in the league during his time in the NHL .
He played good positional defense and had sound offensive skills as well , but his quiet demeanor and low-key playing style kept him below the radar of some observers .
During the 1998â99 NHL season , JÃ¶nsson was named captain of the Islanders .
After almost one season , he stepped down and ultimately , was succeeded by Michael Peca .
He was voted Best Defender of the Tournament at the 2006 Winter Olympics where Sweden won the gold medal .
This was quite surprising considering he had spent a season in the Swedish second division , while most of the other players played in the NHL .
His brother JÃ¶rgen is also a well-known Swedish ice hockey player .
During IHWC 2006 World Championship , with brother JÃ¶rgen initially sidlined by injury , he was named captain of the Swedish national team .

PGPfone
PGPfone was a secure voice telephony system developed by Philip Zimmermann in 1995 .
The PGPfone protocol had little in common with Zimmermann 's popular PGP email encryption package , except for the use of the name .
It used ephemeral Diffie-Hellman protocol to establish a session key , which was then used to encrypt the stream of voice packets .
The two parties compared a short authentication string to detect a Man-in-the-middle attack , which is the most common method of wiretapping secure phones of this type .
PGPfone could be used point-to-point -LRB- with two modems -RRB- over the public switched telephone network , or over the Internet as an early Voice over IP system .
The Internet was not yet ready for PGPfone Â­in 1996 .
There were no protocol standards for Voice over IP .
A decade later , Zimmermann released the successor to PGPfone , Zfone and ZRTP , a new and better secure VoIP protocol based on modern VoIP standards .
Zfone builds on the ideas of PGPfone .
According to the MIT PGPfone web page `` MIT is no longer distributing PGPfone .
Given that the software has not been maintained since 1997 , we doubt it would run on most modern systems . ''
